Version 1.0.0
To do:
- Class definitions for (object) class members
- Documentation
- Flow browser

Bugs:
- Class definition for the following classes contain several 'object' instead of actual types.  For these classes, objects will need to be cast prior to use.
  - ElementInterface 
  - ElementInterfaceStatus
  - IpV4Configuration
  - WanNetwork
  - LanNetwork
  - ApplicationDefinition
  - PolicySet
  - PolicyRule
  - FlowResponse
- Parameters in MetricsQuery should really be enumerations rather than strings
